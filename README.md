# Preliminary Iowa Regional Curves

Stream regional curves are useful for stream restoration practitioners when designing reference channels for flood protection, streambank stability, and other functional objectives. Data has been collected around the US to characterize reference reach geometries, including cross sectional area, bankfull width, bankfull depth, and longitudinal slope of streams. These morphologies are predicted in relation to their contributing drainage area via power law functions. 

The data and script presented here were prepared for the 2020 UMSRS (conference) and the curves are incorporated as a preliminary Iowa design option in Iowa's River Restoration Toolbox. 

Results of this analysis were discussed in poster format, which can be accessed here:
